-Add ability to connect node to graph in dotty (nwdiag does it already)
-Fix GROUP NAME LABEL parsing (not done from all angles)
-Check if something could be done for network graphs .. 
	so that SAME GRAPH printed in dotty would reflect SAME information as printed with actdiag or nwdiag
	not mandatory, but would be NICE
- Make LIST (nodelist,grouplist what ever list) actual object, not array kludge
	- one could then map setLabel to all contained objects in one call
- Make group RECURSIVE...ie. real container. Now it is shallow
- Make EQUAL container property (not it ALWAYS belongs to graphroot, but network diag can have groups inside network..
	well dotty can have subcluster inside subcluster)
